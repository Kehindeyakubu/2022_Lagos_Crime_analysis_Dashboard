# Key Insights

1. **Resource Allocation**:
    - Prioritize law enforcement in high-crime areas (e.g., Alimosho and Agege) by increasing police presence and surveillance.
2. **Seasonal Preparedness**:
    - Anticipate crime surges during festive periods by deploying additional security measures.
    - Focus on reducing theft and robbery through public awareness campaigns and community policing efforts.
3. **Domestic Crime Intervention**:
    - Strengthen support services and local awareness programs for victims of domestic crime.
